# Changelog

Changes to qisiTV and its inherited release history are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Renamed the product, icons, local Agent tools, packages, and runtime identifiers to qisiTV while preserving existing local data and upstream attribution.
- Added LikeAI model support and a shared MCP / CLI interface for external local Agents.
- Built-in BeefAPI can be connected from the desktop app without pasting a key.
- Prepared the first audited public source snapshot.
- Added reproducible local builds, automated quality checks, and multi-architecture container publishing.
- Standardized the upstream public artifacts, runtime identifiers, documentation, and repository links.

## v1.5.3

- Desktop builds show the installed version in the sidebar and check for published updates on startup.
- Signed updates can be downloaded in the app, then installed with an explicit restart while keeping local projects, assets, settings and connections.
- Pending canvas, director and timeline saves are checked before restarting; failed downloads or verification leave the current installation intact.
- Maintainers can build and publish signed macOS and Windows update packages from main. Existing installations need one manual upgrade to this version before in-app updates are available.

## v1.5.2

- Improved canvas node rendering and inline image cropping, annotation, and local redraw interactions.
- Rebuilt the recycle bin with a fixed two-row viewport, selection, recovery, and confirmed permanent deletion.
- Fixed project cover selection across media nodes and canvases, including fallbacks and centered empty placeholders.
- Added a short product demo and updated the README branding.

## v1.5.1

- Initial public upstream snapshot.
- Local-first AI video workspace with image, video, audio, text, asset, canvas, and model-channel workflows.
- BeefAPI remains a built-in local channel while its model catalog is discovered dynamically.
